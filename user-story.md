**User Story 1: Student/Staff Leave Application**

1.  I can successfully submit a leave application with valid start and end dates, and a reason.
2.  I receive a confirmation message upon successful submission.

**Functional Requirements**:
- The system must provide a form for entering leave details (start date, end date, reason).
- The system must validate the entered dates to ensure they are valid and in the future.

**User Story 2: Admin Leave Review and Approval**

**Title**: Review and Manage Leave Applications
**As a** Admin
**I want** to review leave applications, approve or reject them, and view leave history
**So that** I can effectively manage student/staff absences and maintain accurate records.

**Business Logic**:
- Admins can approve or reject leave applications.
- When rejecting, admins must provide a reason for rejection.
- Approved/Rejected leave applications are recorded in the leave history.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. I can view a list of pending leave applications.
2. I can view the details of each leave application (applicant, dates, reason).
3. I can approve or reject a leave application.
